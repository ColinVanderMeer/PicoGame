This is a WIP RPG game that runs on the Hack Club Sprig, a RP2040 based game console. [Demo Video](/static/PicoRPGdemo.mp4)

## How to run
- Download a .uf2 binary from [releases](https://github.com/ColinVanderMeer/PicoGame/releases/latest) or compile a version yourself
- Hold the BOOTSEL button on the back of the sprig and plug it in
