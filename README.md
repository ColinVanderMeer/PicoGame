# PicoGame
This is a WIP RPG game that runs on the Hack Club Sprig, a RP2040 based game console

## How to run
- Download a .uf2 binary from releases or compile a version yourself
- Hold the BOOTSEL button on the back of the sprig and plug it in
- Drag and drop the .uf2 file onto the RPI-RP2 drive

#### Claude Sonnet 3.5 was used for general ideas of how to implement game mechanics
